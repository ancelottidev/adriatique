![Responsive screenshoot](./assets/images/responsive-website-photo.png)

This website was created as a fictitious travel agency for Adriatic, based in Dublin, Ireland.
The aim of the travel agency is to provide a complete service of travel organization for people of all ages who want to visit the Adriatic.

The website contains a home page with three sections. Book Now page that contains a form that the visitor can fill out if he is interested in choosing his desired trip, and the confirmation page which the user is redirected after filling out and submiting the form. About Us page that contains two sections that tell more about the travel agency itself and our bigger goal in the future.
