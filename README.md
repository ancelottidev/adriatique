### Requirements

A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies I have learned so far that contains some advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.

Required technologies: HTML, CSS

### Design

The design for this project came from ”Love Running” project.

My idea for this project was to create a functional and eye-pleasing website for a fictitious travel agency with all my knowledge that I have acquired so far through this course. In my opinion, the design is solid, and I think that in the future I can improve it even more.

#### Typography

The [Google Font Raleway](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@300&display=swap) was chosen as the main font with a fallback of Sans-Serif. Font weight of 300 have been used on the website.

#### Images

The images are selected according to the criterion that they match the text and context. Pictures taken exclusively from the specific place/country to which the context refers.
